Let's walk through the data in the article to figure out what the maximum acquisition cost is that Spotify can bear without suffering a loss. 

| **(1)** **Year** | **(2)** **Monthly** **Revenue per Customer** | **(3)** **Yearly Revenue per Customer** **(2)\*12** | **(4)** **Margin Percentage** | **(5)** **Annual** **Margin** **(m)** **(3)\*(4)** |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 2015             | Eur 7.06                                     | Eur 84.72                                           | 14%                           | Eur 11.86                                          |
| 2017             | Eur 5.24                                     | Eur 62.66                                           | 21%                           | Eur 13.20                                          |

**Optional:** Apply the formula to the data we've collected in the charts above to arrive at the maximum acquisition cost Spotify can bear without suffering a loss. When you are done, click on the button below to see if your solution was correct.

end of 2017

retention=94.9% ()

**The amount of subscribers who end their subscriptions went down from 7.5% in 2015, to 6% in 2016, and 5.1% at the end of 2017**

m=13.20

i=10% assumed

Assume i = 10%

margin multiple=1.1/(1.1-0.949)

| **Year** | **Margin** **Multiple** **(1+i)/(1+i-r)** | **m\*Margin Multiple** **m\*(1+i)/(1+i-r)** | **Maximum** **Acquisition Cost** **A** |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 2015     | 1.1/(1.1-0.7321)= 2.99                    | 2.99*11.86= Eur 35.46 Or $42.55             | $42.55                                 |
| 2017     | 1.1/(1.1-0.811)= 3.81                     | 3.81*13.20= Eur 50.29 Or $60.35             | $60.35                                 |

**The implications of this are:**

The maximum Spotify could afford to pay to acquire a customer in 2015 without making a loss is $42.55

The maximum Spotify could afford to pay to acquire a customer in 2017 without making a loss is $60.35.



So is Spotify's family discounting a good idea?

### **REFLECT**



Let’s take the concept of customer lifetime value and think about how it applies to the ever-growing field of subscription services. Recall from Module 3, companies like Dollar Shave Club, Billie, and Harry's are built on a subscription model.

Is a subscription alone enough to retain a customer?

With so many different razor subscription services out there how can these companies maintain customer loyalty?

Find an example of a subscription-based business. It could be a music service, internet or cell phone service, clothing, razors, dog toys, etc. Look closely at the company and find examples of promotional tactics the company is using to **attract** customers.  Then, look for tactics the company uses to **retain** customers. 



### **POST**



Post a brief description of the company (what do they sell?) and the tactics they are using. Address the following in your post:

- Explain each tactic and whether you believe it is there to attract or retain customers. How does this tactic relate to customer lifetime value?
- What do you guess the cost of each tactic might be? (You are not likely to be able to give a specific cost figure, but do you think this tactic is expensive or inexpensive for the company to execute?)
- For the attraction tactic, do you think the customers gained will be easy to retain, or are customers likely to leave after the promotion ends?
- After posting, vote for the response you things gives the best example and explanation of a company increasing the lifetime value of its customers. 

My post:

Amazon: online retailer

Amazon prime,Personalize customer preferences, great return policy, regular contact, black friday style sales events and product recommendations. All of these tactics increase retention (actually considering different product lines that amazon have, payment/alexa/aws etc..) and makes switch to a competitor very hard hence increasing customer lifetime value

Amazon prime is a great service for customer convenience and expanding sales per customer.Cost of developing algorithms for user profile customization is high however when scaled to their wide customer base, it should be a small fraction.  Return policy would add negative to margin but retention should make it net positive.

Amazon has been able to grow at amazing rate and have ever expanding user base, so, the attraction tactics seems to be working well.
