# JCPenney Case

Read the following JCPenney Case write-up to explore how past JCP choices effected the company.

### History of Penney

The department store JC Penney has been a retail giant and staple of shopping malls for generations. For much of its history, JC Penney was one of the most successful catalog and department stores in the United States, having built a reputation for value since its founding in 1902 as a dry goods merchant. In 1983, JC Penney shifted its focus; it eliminated commodity goods like appliances and hardware and instead sold "fashionable, quality merchandise" that targeted middle Americaâ€”becoming the JC Penney we still recognize today. Since then, Penney became known for constant price promotions. It was "the place your mom dragged you to buy clothes you hated in 1984." Their primary target market was middle-class moms who "loved coupons and the prospect of finding 'steals' via rounds of markdowns."

But in the years surrounding the new millennium, Penney began facing challenges. Stock prices plunged to below $10, merchandise was stale and out-of-touch with customers, and competition from Macy's and Kohl's threatened Penney's legacy. However, starting in 2004, the new CEO Mike Ullman revived Penney with several successful innovations, such as starting an exclusive partnership with cosmetics retailer Sephora and opening stores outside of mallsâ€”setting Penney apart from its competition. In 2007, the stock reached an all-time high of $86 and revenues rose to $19.9 million.

### What happened?

But by 2011, JC Penney was in trouble again. Between 2006 and 2011, revenues dropped by $2.7 billion (or 14%) and stock prices followed. After the 2009 recession, it was clear that the company needed to revisit its strategy, especially since Penney's target customers were hit the hardest by the recession. But Penney struggled to recover. A potentially massive deal with Ralph Lauren fell through when Ralph Lauren would not allow Penney to sell merchandise that carried the much desired Ralph Lauren logo.The refusal to have the logo in Penny stores was not only financially disastrous, but spoke volumes about Penney's brand image. In 2010, pressure from investor Steven Roth and hedge-fund head Bill Ackman raised the stakes. Together, the two bought 26% of the company's stock. They believed that with some changes, JC Penney could once again be a successful department store chain with a $60 stock. But shortly after Ackman and Roth joined the board, Ullman had an accident and could no longer lead the company due to health concerns. JC Penney's future was uncertain.

### What should they do? (Enter Ron Johnson)

Enter Ron Johnson. Johnson was a big name at Apple for creating the monstrously successful Apple storesâ€”the most profitable stores in the worldâ€”and was the innovator who had made the retailer Target hip and trendy. JC Penney had previously contacted Johnson to join their Board of Directors, but he turned them down. Now, for a company in dire need of rejuvenation, Johnson was Ullman's first choice as a new CEO who could take his reins and carry out innovations that would bring Penny back to its glory days. Johnson agreed, driven by his interest in the lack of innovation in retail. In June 2011, Penney announced Johnson as the new CEOâ€”its stock price soaredâ€”and he arrived in early November, ready to spearhead the transformation.

### Ron Johnson Big Plan

Johnson had a particular vision of JC Penney: a youthful, trendy store, "weaned of its addiction to price promotions." In reality, he wanted to Apple-fy JC Penney. There were three main components to his plan for the ailing retail giant: a new pricing strategy, a change to the "place" with an innovative store layout organized as a hundred boutiques, and a transformed product mix that abandoned Penney's traditional brands in an attempt to shift what the Penney brand itself stood for. All of this would be summed up with a new brand name: JCP.

To execute this new strategy, Johnson hired a management dream team from the outside, including Michael Francis from Target and the two Apple alums Mike Kramer and Dan Walker. Together, the three received $24 million in cash signing bonuses.

Johnson based his pricing strategy on a commitment to transparency with consumers. Instead of inflated prices combined with constant sales, there would be three prices: the initial "everyday" price that was "about 40% off the old retail price", "a month-long value price", and a "best" price that served as the final markdown to sell items quickly. The days of clearance were gone. This simplified pricing was risky because Penney's customers were accustomed to "[holding] out for massive discounts."

The stores themselves would now consist of boutiques that would create a "bazaar-like feel" with town squares and coffee bars, drawing crowds as a hangout destination. Johnson's team saw the new Penney as a place where "people would show up in stores because they were fun places to hang out, and that they would buy things listed at full-but-fair price."

Finally, the new Penney would stock shelves with high-end brands, displayed by brand or "collection" rather than the type of product or clothing. For example, in the old layout, all dresses by all brands were together and all women's pants by all brands were together. In the new stores, clothes would be organized so that all piecesâ€”dresses and pantsâ€”by a particular brand (such as Vivienne Tam) would be shelved together. These expensive brands replaced Penney's mainstays such as Southpole and St. John's Bay, which even though were thought of as "drab", "generated $1 billion in annual revenues."

Together, Johnson was ready to create a retail shopping experience like no other. Penney announced the plan less than three months after Johnson became CEO and claimed they would accomplish the transformation by the end of 2015.

### Pros and Cons of Ron's Plan

1. Simple Prices

   - **Pro:**Even though Johnson's new price plan was unfamiliar to consumers, it was based on values of transparency and honesty. The biggest reflection of this was how it streamlined the pricing strategy to make it simpler and clearer for customers. This was done with the three tiers of prices: the initial marked-up retail price, a value price, and the best price for items that Penney wished to sell quickly. This third price is probably closest to what customers were used to under Penney's previous pricing strategy. Through this new three-tiered strategy, Johnson also wanted to clean up the stores, meaning that there wouldn't be aisles of messy clearance items or rushes for huge sales. The new pricing strategy helped cement Johnson's vision for a simpler and more stylish JC Penney.

   - **Con:**Even though Johnson's plan was based on innovation and transparency, it did not translate into benefits for consumers. JC Penney's traditional customers were used to being motivated to shop because of huge, price-slashing deals and were enamored with the "thrill of the hunt," finding the best deals and saving as much as they could. Johnson's new pricing plan did not make this a natural part of the JCP shopping experience. One of the biggest changes that Johnson made was eliminating the clearance section of each department. Finding something on clearance at a substantial mark-down had provided the traditional JC Penney shopper with a reason to visit the store, often making multiple impulse purchases each time. Eliminating the big mark-downs, coupons, and clearance racks were especially detrimental because JC Penney's competition, stores like Macy's and Kohl's, still used these pricing tactics. While Johnson had great intentions with his pricing plan, it did not play the game of retail that customers were used to and enjoyed.

2. New Store Layout

   - **Pro:**Although the new store layout would be expensive to implement and made it more difficult for shoppers to compare prices, Johnson's vision for a new store layout was influenced by his designs for the Apple and Target stores and his objective to change the face of retail. That's just what these boutiques did. No other mid-level department stores were set up with boutiques and town squares. Additionally, this store layout refreshed the JC Penney brand and was the basis for JCPâ€”the trendy, modern retailer. The layout focused consumers' attention on designer collections rather than a category of merchandise, again shifting Penney's own brand image into a retailer concerned with style. The boutiques, and even coffee bars, aimed to make JCP a destination for shoppers, not just a place to get good deals. This high risk conceptâ€”trying a novel layout without testingâ€”would hopefully translate into high reward.

   - **Con:**This layout may have transformed the JCPenney store into a trendier hangout space, however like the pricing plan, this changeâ€”while innovativeâ€”was unfamiliar to JC Penney's customers and did not create something they valued. Penney's traditional target consumer did not care much for shopping by collection, and was more concerned with comparing prices. The store layout made it difficult to compare options and prices for any particular type of items as those options were split up by collection. The other issue with the layout was that it just did not achieve the goal Johnson intended: People simply did not want to go to JCP to hang out. Thus, it failed to attract customers. Additionally, remodeling all of the stores with this new layout was extremely expensive, and the costs fell on the already struggling Penney.

3. New Product Plan

   - **Pro:**Even though their old client base favored low prices over brand names and style, the new product plan furthered Johnson's goals for the new brand by focusing on designer collections. One of the biggest changes was that Penney abandoned their successful mainstay labels (like the drab but profitable St. John's Bay) for brands that were new to Penney and its customers (i.e. Vivienne Tam). This was part of the effort to create the image of trendy JCP and attract new customers who were more focused on style. Johnson also hoped to keep the old customers by enticing them with more stylish products at their trusted neighborhood JC Penney.

   - **Con:**Although the new product plan brought more well-known brands to Penney to attract more style-focus customers, the change in products created multiple problems. First, Penney dropped many of its mainstay brands that had been very profitable for it and replaced them with more expensive and trendier high-end brands. The old product lines did not match Johnson's aspiration for the new image of Penney. But Penney's traditional customers did not favor these brands like the company did. Along with many of the other changes, this change in product lines made these customers feel like Penney was abandoning them. Unfortunately for the retailer, these high-end brands were not appealing to the old customers and not enticing enough to attract new ones. JCP was out of touch.

4. New Mangaement and Staff

   - **Pro:**Even though the old employees had years of experience with Penney and a deep understanding of the Penney customer, Johnson believed he needed all-stars from outside Penney if he was to achieve his innovative and risky plan to completely revamp the brand. These new hires from Apple and Target had experience relevant to Johnson's goals and connections to Johnson from his work at both of these firms. These relationships and connections with Johnson were advantages for the new management because they were already familiar with him and his work. Beyond just the managers, new blood from outside hires at all levels of the staff could have helped refresh the company with new ideas and innovation. This was especially important for JC Penneyâ€”a company stuck in the past, deeply entrenched in their decades-long way of doing things.

   - **Con:**While there are many benefits to bringing in new staff from outside an organization, Johnson's "dream team" created tensions between old and new employees at JC Penney. Even though each manager was successful in his or her own right, all of these external hires gave the impression that the old employees and their expertise, knowledge, and skills were not valued at the new JCP. Additionally, the new staff did not have the knowledge of the JC Penney culture, consumers, or brand that the old employees did and were out-of-touch with the company. This is a natural tension that happens when external hires enter, but the fact that so many managers were buddies with Johnson in an already rapidly changing company culture, caused it to reach new heights. This tension created conflict in the company and reflected the larger friction between the new JCP transformations and JC Penney's century-old tradition.

### What happened?

But what transpired is now a famous disaster: Penney lost $1 billion in 2012 (compared to a loss of only $150 million in 2011), the stock fell to $18 a share (less than half of the previous year's value), and Standard and Poor's reclassified Penney's debt to CCC+, junk bond status. Even though Penney knew sales would drop in the first year, "stores open for at least a year had sold 19% less than in the previous year's first quarter." Johnson's dream collapsed and the board accepted his resignation in April 2012, only seventeen months after he joined the company.

So what happened? Johnson made multiple mistakes at Penney, some of which may seem painfully obvious in hindsight, but all of which were undertaken by smart people with a track record of success. What can we learn from the experience? A few things.

First, Johnson's team did not test the new store layouts or pricing strategiesâ€”the justification being that "we didn't test at Apple." But JC Penney is not Apple. While Apple delivers breakthrough innovations built on technological discoveries, Penney is a retailer in a mature market. Yes, there are many innovations happening in retail, but Penney wasn't making radically different changes, so their customers could have provided useful feedback.

Second, the "no-coupons, no-sales experiment was failing to attract customers." While Penney wanted to practice pricing transparency, they made an assumption that transparency was something that their customers valued. In fact, the opposite was true. Penney's target customers actually enjoyed "the thrill of the hunt" when it came to capturing a good deal, and without promises of discounts, shoppers were no longer compelled to make special trips. Therefore, there was no impulse buying to drive up the average total ticket price.

Third, Penney's lack of attention to customer wants and needs extended to the employees. While traditional customers were alienated because they did not feel like Penney's target anymore, there was a clear rift in the company between old and new employees. Just like the old customers, many of the old employees had been with Penney during its heyday and knew the brand and the customer but did not feel valued in the new JCP. New employees were dismissive, if not disdainful, of the middle-class mom and her couponing waysâ€”and the employees who understood her.

Finally, between the in-store boutiques, Wi-Fi installation for roving store clerks, a disastrous return policy and much more, costs were racking up.

In the end, some believe that Johnson's innovations were not given enough time to work. They claim that the middle-age Mom of tomorrow would be attracted to the glossy stores, the boutiques and the price transparency. But as they say, time waits for no one, least of all for a public company CEO driving revenues in the wrong direction.

Johnson gave himself a notorious reputation, and even today JC Penney is struggling to be the brand and famed retailer that it once was.

### Why do you think it failed?

Pick your primary reason that Johnson's plan didn't work from the list below:

- Dropped their "previous mainstay labels" for higher-end brands, which was not part of the traditional customer's preferences.
- Older and loyal customers didn't feel like they were JC Penney's target market anymore.
- While it alienated its traditional customers, it also didn't attract any new ones.
- New pricing strategy was confusing, and there wasn't familiar terms like "Clearance" and "Sale"

Pick your secondary reason that Johnson's plan didn't work from the list below:

- No-coupons, no-sales experiment was failing to attract customers.
- Didn't test the stores/new pricing strategy, saying "We didnâ€™t test at Apple."
- Separated JCP.com buying groups from store buying groups. Did not provide support for the website.
- Conservative groups were not happy when they announced Ellen DeGeneres as new spokesperson.

Pick your tertiary reason that Johnson's plan didn't work from the list below:

- Board was not super focusedâ€”they spent a lot of time and money worrying about the food at board meetings.
- Had to cut $900 million, looming layoffs decreased employee morale.
- Old and New did not mix, one senior old guard exec said "You felt like you were back in high school with the cool kids and the non-cool kids."
- Costs kept increasing, for example Wi-Fi for roving clerks with iPads.
