A useful way of thinking about a product is to consider the different types of value it delivers. The concept we often use is called the “augmented product”, which says that there are three types of value associated with every product. --> **Functional, Experiential and Symbolic**

At the most basic level, it delivers **functional value. Essentially what does that product or service do for me? **

At the next level, we can think about **experiential value: while it’s delivering functional value, how does it feel? How does it taste or smell or sound? **

Then finally, **symbolic value. We can ask how does that product make me look while using or buying it? Not just how does the product look, but how does it make the customer look?**

In this lecture, we will discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages related to competition, credibility, production, and cost of having a broad product line.
