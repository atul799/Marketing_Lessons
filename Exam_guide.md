## Product Value Analysis:

**There will be two questions about the value created by a product or service. You will read a description of a customer and choose which value (functional, experiential or symbolic) is being described, then you will write WHY in 40 words or less.Review 3.1-3.4 for Product Value Analysis**

Module is about Product

To analyze value we have to first study 5Cs of customer analysis: Customer,company,context,collaboration and competitor.

A useful way of thinking about a product is to consider the different types of value it delivers. The concept we often use is called the **“augmented product”**, which says that there are three types of value associated with every product. --> Functional, Experiential and Symbolic

#### Functional:  Essentially what does that product or service do for me?

####  Experiential : while it’s delivering functional value, how does it feel? How does it taste or smell or sound? 

####  Symbolic :We can ask how does that product make me look while using or buying it? Not just how does the product look, but how does it make the customer look?



### What type of value does DSC create for customer

DSC offers its customers experiential and symbolic value. Watch a few of their ads and you’ll see that DSC’s two main points of differentiation from traditional razors are that they are over-priced and difficult to buy. The humor employed and familiarity Michael Dubin seeks to create with his customers is all about symbolic value. With DSC you save money, and you are smarter for doing so. You are in on the joke; you, like DSC, are cool and funny. Similarly, DSC’s ads that humorously point out the absurd difficulty of buying razors in a story or pharmacy are also about experiential value. As one DSC ad declares: “buying razors sucks. Let us send 'em right to you.” The convenience of online shopping and home delivery are clear examples of experiential value.



### What type of value does Billie create for customers

Billie creates experiential and symbolic value for its customers. Billie’s campaign “Project Body Hair” is all about symbolic value. Billie claims to be the “first women’s razor brand to show hair,” making the point that women's body hair is a taboo subject, but Billie is bold enough to talk about it. Billie also claims to combat the pink tax, not just saving the customer money, but giving her a rebate for past pink razors she bought. While this is economic, it’s also aimed at creating symbolic value for its female customers. However Billie is not just trying to make women feel better about the razor they are using, Billie also creates experiential value by designing razors and body wash that are designed for women. On its website Billie writes: 'Fact: Women and men shave differently. Not all razors are created equal. Ours are designed for womankind.'

## Branding Analysis

**There will be three questions about IBM brand building. **

 ![Branding](./week4/brandAsset.png) 

**You will be given three ads and tweets and then asked to select the area of the pyramid that you believe BEST reflects how IBM is attempting to build its brand equity. **

**Review 4.2-4.7. for Branding Analysis**



Module is about promotion



Promotional tactics deliver messages to consumers, but a **brand** is more than just a message, it's a company's promise to its customers. 

The split between the right and left side of the pyramid represents the "heart" and the "head" of the customer's reaction to and relationship with the brand. In other words, how the customer emotionally "feels" and objectively "thinks" about the brand.



The opEd published by IBM

Within its target segment, IBM had near-universal brand awareness. These ads really work at the second level of the pyramid by developing the set of associations the target market has with the brand. They work to refine and expand how the target market views the solutions that IBM can bring -- the left side of the pyramid associated with **performance**. In the aspirational text of solving big, complex problems faced by the planet, they also work at the third level on the right side, creating **feelings** of warmth, self-respect and social approval by solving these problems.

Smartplanet TV commercial:

These ads function at both the top and the bottom of the pyramid. It brings the “Smarter Cities” campaign to the individuals in a city, and it is an example of IBM working at the top of the pyramid -- **engagement and community**.

## Consumer Buying Behavior / Promotion Analysis:

**There will be three questions about how promotional activities can target customers at different stages of the consumer buying process. You will be given an ad and asked to pick at what stage of the consumer buying process is the ad targeting consumers.**

**Review 1.1-1.3 and 4.1 for Consumer Buying Behavior / Promotion Analysis**

Module 1: know your customer

Module 4: promotion

### Question 1 of 4

Often low-involvement items want to have the most marketing impact at the spot location (shelf, stand, store) where they are sold. This is referred to as the “________________.” --> Point of purchase

### Question 2 of 4

Developing ads to try and convince a customer they need your product, even before they may recognize that need themselves is the ___________ stage. --> Needs recognition

### Question 3 of 4

A company providing descriptions and reviews of a product in an online shopping space where customers engage in meaningful conversation about a product, would be advertising in what stage? --> Information search

### Question 4 of 4

The ____ process is when the consumer hasn’t yet recognized a need but notices an opportunity and then makes a decision to purchase, or not to purchase, a good or service. --> Hedonic

**Utilitarian/High Involvement** : Know --> Feel --> do

You recognize your need and research alternatives until you finally bought the particular model that made the most sense for you

**Low Involvement**: Know--> do --> feel

**You identify your need and act on it**

**Hedonic/Self-Expressive**: feel-then-do

**Following your wants rather than needs**

------------------------------------------

## Pricing -Total Economic Value:

**There will be three questions about the total economic value of a product for a customer. The question will be the same format as the question in 6.4.**

**Review 6.3-6.4 for Total Economic Value**

Module 6: Price

Pricing strategies: Penetration pricing, Skimming, and Bundling

### **StrongCoat - The Cable Coating Case**

**Background**

After your MBA, you get a great job at PolyCo, a company known for innovation. PolyCo has often faced the problem of determining the economic value for new, differentiated products. When you arrive on the job, PolyCo is about to introduce **StrongCoat**, a covering for communication cables used in buildings. PolyCo sells its polymer coating to cable manufacturers. So StrongCoat will compete with other coatings currently manufactured with cables. 

StrongCoat has a differentiating advantage. Tests indicate their cable is substantially more durable:

| Cable Failure Rate |                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| StrongCoat cables  | Competitor cables |
| 3%                 | 8%                |

**Your Role**

Your boss walks into your office and asks you to help PolyCo set a price for StrongCoat. Below is a summary of your conversation with her. 

Determining the right price for StrongCoat is complicated because to figure out what the coating is worth, you need to understand if more durable and more reliable communications cables are worth more to the people who build and operate office buildings. Your boss assures you that it is.

Despite her scientific background and lack of MBA, she has a good nose for marketing. She conducted a few interviews with cable makers AND their customers. Here are some facts she discovered about buyers of the communication cables. She specifically talked to large-scale office building managers who use such cables to provide communications infrastructure to their tenants.   

- The next best alternative on the market to a cable covered with StrongCoat is a cable covered with a generic material. That cable sells for $6.50 per one hundred feet. 
- Generic coating sells for $0.28 per pound to cable manufacturers.
- It takes 16.25 pounds to coat 100 feet of cable.
- With StrongCoat covering, the cable is more durable which means that building managers have to buy less replacement cable, specifically 5% less (based on 8% to 3% reduction in failure). 
- The labor cost to a building manager of replacing a failed 100-foot section of cable is about $60.  
- When cable failure occurs during critical business hours, it can lead to revenue loss for the building manager via refunds owed to tenants for communication outages. This “outage refund” (as it is called) might range from $0, if the failure occurred after hours or on weekends, to $40 if during the most critical times of the day. These critical hours make up approximately 20% of the time the building is in use.  
- Your boss has done customer interviews with cable manufacturers and knows that cable makers don't like to be beholden to a sole source. Therefore, PolyCo will compensate them for this at $0.33 per 100 feet of cable. 
- However, StrongCoat cable will be more expensive and manufacturers will need to convince builders to pay for higher quality cable at $1.30 per 100 feet of cable
- The last piece of information, that you already knew is as follows: to make StrongCoat (Cost of Goods Sold, or COGS) is $0.25 per pound.  PolyCo has market intelligence estimates that the “generic” coating sold by PolyCo’s competitors has a manufacturing cost (COGS) of approximately $0.22 per pound.

------------

Reference value:   

$6.50 per one hundred feet

Generic coating sells for $0.28 per pound to cable manufacturers

It takes 16.25 pounds to coat 100 feet of cable

Reference value: $0.28/pound --> 0.28*16.25= $4.55/100 feet of cable

Positive differentiation value:

With StrongCoat covering, the cable is more durable which means that building managers have to buy less replacement cable, specifically 5% less (based on 8% to 3% reduction in failure). 

5% of 6.50=$0.325/100 feet of cable --> 16.25 pounds

for coating pricing=0.325/16.25=$0.02/pound of coating

The labor cost to a building manager of replacing a failed 100-foot section of cable is about $60.  

5% of $60=$3/100 feet of cable

for coating pricing=3/16.25=$0.18/pound





When cable failure occurs during critical business hours, it can lead to revenue loss for the building manager via refunds owed to tenants for communication outages. This “outage refund” (as it is called) might range from $0, if the failure occurred after hours or on weekends, to $40 if during the most critical times of the day. These critical hours make up approximately 20% of the time the building is in use. 

20% of 40$ (unit??)=$8

5% of $8=$0.4 --> 100 feet

0.4/16.25=0.02/pound

Negative differentiation value:

Your boss has done customer interviews with cable manufacturers and knows that cable makers don't like to be beholden to a sole source. Therefore, PolyCo will compensate them for this at $0.33 per 100 feet of cable. 

preferred supplier (??) : $0.33/100 feet 

0.33/16.25=0.02/pound



However, StrongCoat cable will be more expensive and manufacturers will need to convince builders to pay for higher quality cable at $1.30 per 100 feet of cable

$1.30/100 feet of cable

1.3/16.25=$0.08

The last piece of information, that you already knew is as follows: to make StrongCoat (Cost of Goods Sold, or COGS) is $0.25 per pound.  PolyCo has market intelligence estimates that the “generic” coating sold by PolyCo’s competitors has a manufacturing cost (COGS) of approximately $0.22 per pound.

ceiling price: 0.25$/pound

### Calculate

What is the **total economic value** to building managers of one hundred feet of cable covered with StrongCoat? *(If you calculate this for your new boss, you are going to look like a marketing rock star.)*  



My Calc:

Total Economic value=0.28+0.02+0.18+0.02-0.02-0.08=$0.4/pound







![](./week6/TEV1.PNG)

From cable point of view:

cost for generic coating cable/100 feet: $6.50 per one hundred feet

replacement cable advantage: 5% of 6.50=$0.325/100 feet of cable

labor cost saving: 5% of $60=$3/100 feet of cable

power outage saving:20% of 40$ =$8 =5% of $8=$0.4



![](./week6/TEV2.PNG)

From coating point of view:

Reference cost=$0.28/pound --> 0.28*16.25= $4.55/100 feet (0.28/pound)

Positive differentation:

replacement advantage: 5% of 6.50=$0.325/100 feet of cable (A) (0.325/16.25=0.02)

labor: 5% of $60=$3/100 feet of cable   (B)  (3/16.25=0.18)

power outage saving:20% of 40$ =$8 =5% of $8=$0.4 (C) (0.4/16.25)

A+B+C=0.325+3+0.4=3.725



Negative differentiation:

if cable fail less the customer buys 5% less: 6.5 (current price of cable/100 feet) -4.55(cost of coating for 100 feet)= 1.955/100 feet --> 5% less is 0.0975 cent/100 feet  (D)

supplier preference:  $0.33/100 feet  (E)

expense for manufactures to use higher qlty coating: $1.30/100 feet of cable (F)

D+E+F= 0.0975+0.33+1.30=1.7275

R+A+B+C-D-E-F=4.55+0.325+3+0.4-0.0975-0.33-1.30=6.55
