### Module 7: Keeping Customer Centered Approach

## What you need to know about a customer-centric approach



This is our last module of the course and we brought Professor P.K. Kannan in to help us share this important approach to marketing. Here we explore keeping your focus on the customer, or "customer centricity". 

It is a specific perspective taken to manage the marketing function - instead of being product-centric you take a customer-centric approach. This holistic viewpoint encompasses the 5C's of Analysis, the S(egmentation)T(argeting)P(ositioning) of Strategy, and the 4P's (Product,promotion,place,price) of Action to develop strategies and tactics to enhance the value provided to the customers and thus increase the value the firms receive in return.
