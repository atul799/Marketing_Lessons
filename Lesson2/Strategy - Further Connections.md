## Strategy - Further Connections



### Smith Spotlight

To conclude our look at strategy, here's an additional resource for you. Smith Spotlights feature research and conversations with Smith faculty which directly connect to what you're learning in Marketing Management. Throughout the course, Smith Spotlights will either show you the real-life application of a topic in the course or take a deeper dive on what you're learning. Either way, we hope you enjoy them!

Bootstrapped is a podcast that comes out of Smith's Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship. This episode tackles marketing with the help of Bob London, the Founder and CEO of Chief Listening Officers and an active Dingman Center Entrepreneur-in-Residence and 1776 Startup Mentor. During a time when there is a constant “war for customer’s attention,” London advocates for listening. If your startup is not getting customers, try asking someone, “What would make you a customer for life?" Starting with a customer’s “elevator rants” or complaints about a product or service makes for a solid foundation for a new enterprise.
