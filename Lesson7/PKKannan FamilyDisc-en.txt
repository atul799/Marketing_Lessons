- As we saw in the article,
Spotify introduced family plans with discounts
which reduced the average revenue per customer per month
from 7.06 Euro in 2015
to 5.24 Euro in 2017.
Now is this a good move?
Let's see what happened with the introduction
of the family plan.
Revenues per customer may have gone down,
but retention rates have increased
from 73% to 81% as we just saw.
Margin as a percentage of revenues has gone up too,
from 14% to 21%.
The net effect of these increases in retention rates
and margin percentage have more than compensated
for the revenue decrease as a result of the family plan.
Now why am I saying this?
In 2015 margin times margin multiple
was about $42.55.
While in 2017 it has gone up to $60.35.
So if the acquisition cost remained the same,
customer lifetime value has actually increased.
But what if margin remained at 14% in 2017 also?
Then margin times margin multiple is only about $40.23,
which is actually a slight decrease
from the $42 that we had in 2015.
But family plan makes acquisitions very easy.
As more customers sign up, the customer base increases,
and the fixed costs get covered over a larger customer base,
so margins go up.
So overall family discounting has really helped.
The analysis that we just did was one just example
of how customer lifetime value can be used as the metric
to measure whether companies are doing the right thing
in building the value of their firms.
We can use customer lifetime value to measure the impact
of marketing promotions, like this family plan,
Pricing strategies, new ways to acquire customers
and whether they are justifiable and a lot more.
It also allows us to understand
why customer satisfaction matters,
why customer loyalty matters,
as these impact retention rates positively
which impact customer lifetime value positively.
