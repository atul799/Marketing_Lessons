#### 1. How to reach the next generation

discussion posted 26 days ago by [JonathanBM](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:USMx+BUMM612+2T2019/discussion/forum/users/25164005)



According to Nielsen, Millennials are harder to reach with marketing exposures than the generation before it and Generation Z (following the Millennial generation) is even less responsive to marketing exposures. Is this a topic that marketers are discussing at the moment? Are there any firms that have taken this on as an issue to solve?

Johnathan, this is a great topic to discuss in our live chat on Wednesday. As you can imagine, each generational cohort, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z, have different communication preferences. When you ask if there are "firms that have taken this on as an issue to solve," do you mean companies that offer products that appeal across generations (Kellogg's, for example) or agencies that specialize in this type of work (Ogilvy and McCann)? Can you provide a link to the article you saw from Nielsen? Thanks, Dr. Furst

#### Experiential value

question posted 28 days ago by [Fernando-Suarez-Chocano]

Hello. Does experiential value only relate to the senses while using the product or service? Or it also relates to that extra feeling of comfort (or other positive feeling) one may experience while actually buying the product?

This post is visible to everyone.

   Fernando, this is an interesting question. Services have the distinction of being consumed at the same time they are purchased--a haircut, movie, doctor visit, etc. Experiential value is tied to the aesthetics of the product (or service) in this case. So, when you go the barber or salon to get a haircut, if your stylist is focused on you, asking questions about your day, massaging your scalp, and the salon smells clean and fresh, you are having a positive experience. This experiential value is also linked to your willingness to return to the salon. (Imagine the hairstylist/barber having a bad day--grumpy, complaining about a previous customer, etc. You might be tempted to jump out of the chair!)

   The functional, experiential, and symbolic benefits of a haircut are 1) your hair is shorter and neater, 2) your hair smells nice from the shampoo and you got a shoulder massage, 3) you feel confident about your appearance.

   Let me know what you think! Dr. Furst

   1. Thanks Fernando for asking this question, and Dr. Furst for the explanation. Is it possible to get example scenarios like this for each section of the pyramid? Is there a reference or handout commonly used or created for it. Your explanation makes it much more easy to comprehend the concepts in the pyramid.

   3. Thank you Dr. Furst, so from the example you cited I could tell that the experience of comfort one gets from a stylist service also comes from the senses (the nice smell, the massage). After all, everything perceived from the senses go to the brain and one decides if the experience using the product or consuming the service is or isn't good.

         Hi all! I'm here to provide an additional example that will hopefully illuminate the concept of the brand pyramid. First, let's establish why the brand pyramid is important. Among the many reasons Keller (2009) suggests that strong brands benefit an organization are increasing customer loyalty, creating a halo of the product's/service's performance, and allowing brand extensions.
    
         So, let's look at a well-known brand and describe each of the building blocks--Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup (CCNS) should work.
    
         At the base is brand salience: how often customers think of the brand in certain situations. Imagine you have a lousy cold...its raining and miserable outside and all you want to do is curl up with something warm and feel better. Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup has strong brand salience in that scenario.
    
         Looking at the brand pyramid, the left side is the "rational route" and the right side is the "emotional route" (Keller, 2009, p.144). Let's look at the rational side first. Brand performance examines how well the product solves your need for warm, healthy food. *(Pretty well.)* Brand judgments are based on your own evaluations and experiences. *(I felt better last time I had a cold when I ate CCNS.)*
    
         Now, let's consider the emotional route to building a brand, brand imagery and brand feelings. Brand imagery includes the way the brand meets a customer's psychological or social needs. *(When I was a child, my mom gave me CCNS when I had a cold and that brings back a memory of someone caring for me.)* Brand feelings are the emotional responses the brand generates. *(I feel better and comforted by the soup.)*
    
         Finally, brand resonance is the relationship the customer develops with the brand. How attached is the customer to the brand? *(I feel really lousy when I have a cold...the ONLY food I want is CCNS. I'm not willing to try anything else because the risk of the other product failing me is too high. I just want my CCNS.)*
    
         The beauty of the strong brand created by CCNS is the [brand extensions](https://www.campbells.com/campbell-soup/our-soups/): Chunky, Chunky Max, Soup on the Go, Healthy Choice, etc. These brand extensions have increased the profitability of the brand. The Campbell's Soup brand is said to have high brand equity.
    
         To see some examples of how the brand has been managed, take a look at these commercials and look for signs of both the rational and emotional route to creating brand equity.

#### Brand Pyramid

discussion posted 25 days ago by [tMalachi](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:USMx+BUMM612+2T2019/discussion/forum/users/5625258)



Can someone please explain the Brand Pyramid? I dont feel that I fully grasped the concepts. Does the brand strategy encompass all levels, with the base as the foundation element? Does the brand strategy then work it's way and become "fully complete" or "fully realized" when it hits on the top element?

I do not understand if the teaching is implying that the overall brand strategy must hit each pyramid component, but individual marketing tactic/promotion within the overall strategy is aimed at a specific section of the pyramid.

tMalachi, Thanks for your question...I'll take a shot at explaining. Please let me know if this clarifies the concept. (I'll also be live on Wednesday from 11 - noon and we can talk further if you like.)

A product can have functional, experiential, and symbolic value to the customer. Returning to marketing strategy--understanding the wants/needs/preferences of customers and how customers make decisions--we can take a look at how strategy dictates the features in our product or service and how we should communicate, price, and make the product available (i.e., the 4 Ps).

Let's look at the decision to purchase a new push lawn mower. Mine broke and the grass is getting tall (my need). I'm going to look around for information about the possible brands and features available. Imagine I have a small yard but there is a big hill, thus I need a self-propelled lawnmower. I'll also ask friends and family for information, check out reviews online, and perhaps even visit the local hardware store (stage 2, information search). I have some brands to consider, a set of features that may or may not be important to me, and choices about where I can purchase the lawnmower. In this evaluation of the alternatives, I am likely to be very logical and concentrate on the functional benefits (self-propelled, buy at a local store, has a warranty, good reviews online, etc.). I may pay some attention to how using the lawnmower will make me feel (experiential)--efficient and capable. It's not likely that I'll focus too much on the symbolic value (unless of course my pesky neighbor is a know-it-all and will be impressed by my choice of brand X lawnmower). In this case, knowing that buying a lawnmower is a utilitarian decision for most customers driven by functional benefits will also be reflected in the other Ps. Check out this advertisement for a Toro lawnmower https://youtu.be/WoipxpA7Ins and look for the functional benefits.

By contrast, consider a hedonic process. I see it, and I like it, so I buy it. What is it? Imagine that "it" is an outfit for a wedding. I know that I'm going to be photographed and someone will likely ask where I got the outfit and even the brand, so the experiential and symbolic value will be much more important to me. Thus, the outfit will be featured at a high-end department store, advertised by showing the model wearing it at a fancy event, smiling and confident.

In summary then, the product tactics will support the marketing strategy, driven by the customer.

Let me know if this helps clarify! Dr. Furst

tMalachi, I don't think I answered your question. Here's an explanation of the brand pyramid (see below). Additionally, you asked if a brand should strive to meet all levels of the pyramid. Yes, it should, although they do not always succeed. Brands with high value (equity) do strive to resonate with customers and get there by both a rational and emotional route.

Hi all! I'm here to provide an additional example that will hopefully illuminate the concept of the brand pyramid. First, let's establish why the brand pyramid is important.

(When I was a child, my mom gave me CCNS when I had a cold and that brings back a memory of someone caring for me.)

Thank you so much, Professor Furst! This definitely helps. I needed the situational examples to make the concepts concrete for me.

Let me make sure I've understood: Determining the product strategy and creating a brand identity have different objectives in that strategy is aiming to deliver value based on what's driving customer motivations while brand identify is aiming to influence the customer's perception of the product's as able to fulfill his product expectations?

After the customer has identified a need and made the decision to acquire a product, consideration will be given to the driving value (functional, experiential, symbolic) behind the final product purchasing decision. In that process, the brand identify will be a filtering factor for which products are considered and/or trusted to meet the need. So, in the evaluation of brands to consider, the pyramid enters the equation based on how well the company (1) establishes brand salience in the need area, (2) builds brand imagery in a way that the customer can positively envision the brand delivering, (3) generates an emotional response to the need being met, and (4) sustains a relationship between the customer and the brand.

Customers determine the value delivered in a product and the brand identify affects whether certain products make it into the list of viable options. Once a brand a solidly a viable option (or the only option) that customers consider for a specific need, then the company can create brand extensions, more easily convincing the customer that the extensions will as well. In that way the customer begins to narrow the main choice down to the brand, then viable options become those within that specific brand itself maintaining the customer loyalty and providing additional revenue streams across products.

Is this correct?

So glad you were able to join us. Yes, I would imagine that on several aspects US customers are different from German customers--and Italian, Chinese, Brazilian, and Nigerian customers. :-) Depending on the segment you are targeting, there are going to be differences within each country, too. There are research organizations that examine the differences across customers and product/service classifications like Mintel and Passport Euromonitor. You might take a look and see if you can get some information from sources like this.

Hope this helps! Dr. Furst

   Saad, I believe you have caught a typo in the module overview. Thank you!

   It looks like it has been fixed now. *In this module, weâ€™ll study the element of marketing that is likely to be very familiar to most people: Promotion and Branding. Weâ€™ll also spend the next few modules covering important topics that integrate these pieces. Module 4 again talks about Actions the firm takes.*

   The objectives for the module 4 are clearer.

   *At the end of this module, you will be able toâ€¦ Classify the different stages of the consumer buying process at which promotion can be applied. Identify the parts of the brand-building framework. Analyze how promotion can build your relationship with customers through branding.*

   Pricing will be covered in module 6 in detail.

   Thanks again for bringing this typo to my attention! Dr. Furst

   1. Excellent. I am looking forward to learn more about pricing strategy especially when the competitor's product is cutting us by giving a lower price on a product with similar features.
