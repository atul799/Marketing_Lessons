Based on insights we’ve developed about the customer, the market, our competitors
and our company, we formulate our strategy.
This includes number one, an approach to segmentation, dividing the market into categories of potential
consumers, number two, choice of a segment or segments to target, and number three, positioning
our product, figuring out what promise we want to make to our target customer that will
effectively differentiate us from our competitors.
After the strategy is established, we transition to the action phase.
We actually do something!
Here, we often use the four P’s framework -- product, place, promotion, and price -- to
think about the set of decisions we need to make.
Of course, throughout, we’re using the positioning statement to guide our choice about what price
to set, what ad to run, where to sell and, as we’ll discuss here, what our product
should look like.
