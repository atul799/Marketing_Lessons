## 6.2 - Learn: Introduction to Total Economic Value

## Read

On the previous pages, we covered several pricing strategies: Penetration pricing, Skimming, and Bundling. However, we still haven’t done a deep dive into how you set your initial price as a start point for those strategies. We’ll do that now.

You may be wondering why we haven't discussed another, simpler way of pricing: Setting your price at some fixed percentage above your cost to manufacture a good or provide a service. To put it simply, we haven’t covered that approach because that is rarely the best way to set your price.

As the first video in this module says, we want to set our prices based on the value we create for our customers, not based on our costs. However, many firms are less enlightened and, because it’s simpler, they base their price on their costs. Further, it’s not uncommon to find proponents of this process among those with technical backgrounds. Watch the lecture below and learn the 4 big reasons cost-plus-pricing is a bad idea.

 So what is a better way to price? Price on value. When we talk about value pricing, we are talking about pricing our product based on the value it creates for our customers. In order to figure out what that value is, we calculate the total economic value. Watch the Total Economic Value video to get an overview of the concept.
