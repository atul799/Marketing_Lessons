I’ll talk today about a very common pricing approach called bundling.
Bundling,or selling products as a package, is something we see each and every day in
different forms.
To appreciate the firm’s problem, let’s look at an example.
Imagine that I'm in a business where I sell two products: hot dogs and beer.
Sounds like an exciting business.
Now, let's make it even more specific and say I'm the New England Patriots.
How should we charge for these two products?
One option is a la carte pricing.
I could charge, say, $10 for a beer and $7 for a hot dog.
Or I could bundle.
This means you can only buy or you have the option to buy, a bundle comprised of a beer
and a hot dog at some price, typically lower than the a la carte price.
Again, we see bundled pricing almost everywhere: for example McDonald's Happy Meals.
Historically, most cable companies provided content in bundles.
As a final example, University of Maryland degree programs are also an example of bundling.
You might want to only take marketing strategy, but you can't.
You've got to get an entire MBA degree if you want to take this course.
So, why is bundling so common?
There are four main reasons: heterogeneity in preferences, price discrimination, leverage,
and differentiation.
You should think of these as contexts in which bundling may be a prefered option.
Let me give you an example in a context of preference heterogeneity.
Imagine these are our two customers and they each have a willingness to pay for each of
the two products.
The gentleman on the left is willing to pay $10 for beer but only $1 for a hot dog.
On the right, he's willing to pay $1 for a beer but $10 for a hot dog.
This example is extreme preference heterogeneous, but it illustrates the concept well.
How should I price?
If I do a la carte pricing, the optimal prices will be $10 for beer and $10 for a hot dog.
I'll sell one beer, one hot dog, and make $20.
On the other hand, I could bundle price.
I could say "The only way you can do business with me is if you pay $11 for a beer and a
hot dog."
Then, they'll both buy the bundle and I'll make $22.
It should be clear here that just because they had **heterogeneous preferences** - and extreme
heterogeneous preferences - I was able to bundle price and do strictly better than I
could with a la carte prices.
A second reason for bundling is **price discrimination**.
Price discrimination means that we can offer multiple pricing options, one of which is
bundling, and we may do even better.
Let's imagine we’re with our same customers at the Patriots game.
We'll add a third customer who has more moderate preferences and is willing to pay $8 each
for a hot dog and a beer.
Let’s go through the same exercise.
First, we can try a la carte prices, where the optimal price would be $8 for a beer and
$8 for a hot dog.
The man on the left would buy a beer, the man on the right would buy a hot dog, and
our new customer would buy both a hot dog and beer.
In total, we would sell two beers, two hot dogs, and make $32.
Second, we can try only bundling.
The optimal bundle would again be $11 and we would make $33 in total because everybody
would buy the bundle.
Finally, we can offer both a la carte prices and bundle prices.
We return to our $10 a la carte prices for our original customers, but the bundle now
becomes $16 because of our new customer.
By offering both options, we’ll now make $36.
Because of the difference in preferences and our method of price discrimination, the bundling
option lets us do much better.
Third, another very common reason for bundling is **leverage**.
This might be what you first thought of when I introduced bundling.
This involved using relative strength in one product market to raise demand in another.
A common example of this is in the pricing policies of many theatres.
While some a la carte tickets may be available, successful theatres often book a small number
of well-known or highly-regarded productions which are bundled with a number of other lesser-known
performances in a “season’s ticket.”
Thus the “pull” of the former creates additional demand for the latter.
The final reason researchers have argued for why we see bundling is **differentiation** ; sometimes
it’s just better to be different.
It reduces competition as well as necessary investments in marketing tactics, including
price cuts.
So what we see in some industries, such as automotive, is that some manufacturers do
a la carte pricing and others do bundling in an effort to access different segments
and thereby, again, mitigate excessive competitive battles.
So to summarize, when deciding whether to bundle or not, I want to ask whether any of
these condition exist: preference heterogeneity, opportunities for price discrimination, a
strong product with leverage, or simply differentiation from a competitor.
