## 6.1 - Learn: Pricing Strategies

### Read

How do you capture the value you've created? How much is your customer willing to pay for the value you've created? These are questions we all must explore when making decisions around pricing.

In this module, we will do a general survey of three pricing strategies: 

**Skimming**
**Penetration**
**Bundling**

Then we will do a comprehensive study of value based pricing and look at reasons why you should NEVER use **Cost Plus Pricing** and should instead use **Total Economic Value** to price your product or service.

On this page, we will give a brief overview of the first three strategies. Then, on the following pages, we will cover why Cost Plus Pricing is such a bad idea, which will lead into a detailed discussion of the topic of this module's case: Total Economic Value. This is going to take more effort to work through but rest assured, it is worth it. Once you have this calculation in your skill set, you will be ready to accurately advise pricing policy.

Now we will cover the options of Skimming and Penetration together since they are opposite choices driven by your strategy.

**Skimming:** In skimming, we initially set a high price with hopes of ‚Äúskimming off‚Äù or selling to those customers that have the highest willingness to pay.

**Penetration:** Penetration pricing is the opposite. The firm sets a low price right from the outset and sells to the mass market at an affordable price.

Let's learn more about their differences and when we might choose one over the other.

Here we will cover another third of our general discussion on pricing considerations. We have explored Skimming and Penetration. Now we will cover the pros and cons of Bundling.

**Bundling:** putting products together and forcing the customer to buy them as a package

### Post

**Think of a product or service.**

- What is the market willing to pay for this and how might it differ across customers?
- What is the lowest cost you could consider charging?

Do any of these conditions exist for your product/service?

1. - Preference heterogeneity
   - Opportunities for price discrimination
   - A strong product with leverage
   - Differentiation from a competitor
   - An opportunity to use a skimming strategy 
   - An opportunity to use penetration pricing 
   - An opportunity to bundled your product with other products

Complete the following in the discussion board below:

1. 1. Post the name and a brief description of your product or service. 
   2. Be creative. Choose TWO of the conditions from the above list that you could use for your product/service.
   3. Write 2-4 sentences, describing how your product/service fulfills at least two of the conditions above.
   4. Vote for at least 3 comments that you agree with.
   5. Comment on at least one peers' post to suggest more ideas of what they might do.

2. ##### Mypost

3. Product: food and food delivery service

4. lowest cost: Pizza : 10*ùëë**ùëí**ùëô**ùëñ**ùë£**ùëí**ùëü**ùë¶*:5

5. Preference Heterogeneity: Working families can pay more for the delivery service while families that have non working members won't.

6. Price Discrimination opportunity: The product offering can be a la carte and bundling pricing. There would be customer who want to take away and food delivered. So the opportunity for price discrimination exists.

7. The product and service would be offered as separate (skimming) as well bundled pricing.
