- So let's look now how we can apply the concepts
of customer lifetime value to real life situation.
Recently, there was an article about Spotify,
the music streaming service, which went public
with an IPO in April of 2018.
I'm sure you must have all heard of,
and most likely use, Spotify,
which provides free music streaming service
interrupted with a lot of advertisements,
or you can pay a monthly subscription fee
for its premium service with no ads.
Amidst the clutter of music streaming services
like Apple Music, Goggle Play, Tidal, Pandora, and Amazon,
Spotify is holding its own and growing significantly.
Which is not a small achievement given that some
of its competitors are big pocketed tech companies.
The Wall Street Journal article provided a lot of numbers
about the revenues, margins, and retention rates
of Spotify for the last three years.
Which makes up for interesting study
about their customer lifetime value
and thus the overall value of the firm.
We will now look at it.
