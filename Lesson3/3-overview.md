## 3- Ensure Product deliver on your strategy



So far, we’ve discussed customer analysis and the core strategic decisions in marketing: Segment, Target, and Position (STP). Now we’ll cover the actions or decisions that have to be made to execute that strategy; these are the famous 4P's--Product, Promotion, Place, and Price.

### Lecture - Introduction to Product



<VIDEO>



Note that these four Ps are not the only ones that matter. You might also find that People, Processes, Physical Evidence, Packaging, and even things that don’t start with P to be important actions. However the 4P's we’ve outlined here will cover most of your bases.  

In Module 3 we explore facets of the first P: Product or Product Design. We will cover product policy and product lines and discuss what it means to deliver a “whole product” to your customer. A whole product is a turn-key solution--everything your customer needs to solve their problem--which can streamline their experience and induce them to buy.

For verified users, the concepts will all come together in a business case in the weird world of razors. 

At the end of this module, you will be able to…

- Explain the intersection between Strategy and the 4Ps or action steps.
- Describe the three types of value associated with every product.
- Distinguish the benefits of a broad product line and a narrow product line.
- Apply the concept of product value in a number of real-life companies.
- Demonstrate the ability to craft a positioning statement informed by product considerations.
