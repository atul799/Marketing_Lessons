### Read

Now we move on to the third of the 4P's, Place. Even if you have chosen your target market, created the perfect product and devised an excellent promotion plan, you still need to determine where your customers will purchase your product or service. The **Place** or **Channel** where you sell your product can have a significant impact on your target segmentsâ€™ awareness of your product, the availability of your product where and when they want to buy it, and your ability to serve many of their needs.  The channel influences your profit margin and as well as the perception of your brand.  In this section, you'll learn about managing channels and choosing the right channel strategy.

In this module, **Place** refers to more than just the final location your product is sold but to the whole distribution process as well as the partners that move a product from the producer to the customer. In this section, we will refer to this as **channel design** and **management.**

### **Push and Pull Promotion defined:**

Once you get your products into place they still will not sell themselves. You will need to incentivize both the channel and the customer. You can invest in your customers to demand or "**Pull**" your product from the channel or you can invest in the place and get the channel to "**Push**" your product to the customer. When we say "incentivize", we mean spend money. Therefore, since you are spending money to promote within the channel we call it Push and Pull promotion.
