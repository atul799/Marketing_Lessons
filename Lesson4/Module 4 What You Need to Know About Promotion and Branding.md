### Module 4: What You Need to Know About Promotion and Branding

In this module, we’ll study the element of marketing that is likely to be very familiar to most people: Promotion and Branding. We’ll also spend the next few modules covering important topics that integrate these pieces. Module 4 again talks about Actions the firm takes.

**Promotion** includes all of the activities that a firm does to communicate (or promote) its products and services to its target market.  These promotional tactics may include a website, television advertising, salesforce, social media, and many others.

A **brand** is more complicated.  It’s how people perceive a firm’s product, service, experience or organization.  It includes the reality of a firm’s offering as well as the perception that a customer has of that offering.  Brands live in a customer’s mind; firms work to influence brands but do not entirely have control over them.

**Promotion** is the primary way firms convey their brand identity and their brand’s meaning to customers.

At the end of this module, you will be able to…

- Classify the different stages of the consumer buying process at which promotion can be applied. 
- Identify the parts of the brand-building framework.
- Analyze how promotion can build your relationship with customers through branding.
