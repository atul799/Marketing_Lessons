### Guidelines for Our Case Method



Case studies are an important component of any business education.

They’re different from reading a textbook or listening to a lecture because they help

you develop your thought process.

Let me put it differently, the goal of analyzing cases is to learn how to make decisions, and

we do that by putting ourselves in the seat of a, usually real, decision maker.

Before you get started, here are two important points to remember while working on case studies.

First, do not search online for answers of what happened after the case.

This is often considered academically dishonest in an academic program and it negates the

learning objectives for the case.

What happens in real life is not the only or even the best decision, sometimes it’s

not even relevant for our goals in the course.

Second, we ask that you not judge the learning potential of a case ahead of time.

Even if you’re not personally invested in the topic or the industry, it’ll still be

a valuable learning resource for you.

Actually my experience, the best cases, the ones students learn the most from, are drawn

from industries that students have little overt interest in, at least exante.

I just think it’s easier sometimes to wade through the case facts and identify what’s

really important and what the driving forces are in a decision when you are a bit less

excited about the industry.

Ultimately, all these steps will help you learn the material, concepts and even connections

between the concepts for class assignments, exams, and real world applications.

For this course, we’ve created unique cases for each module that will allow you to apply

the principles you’ve learned so far.

These cases are interactive, requiring you not just to read and watch, but to engage

with the case.

You’ll interact with other classmates and have the chance to consult on real world marketing

problems.

The goal is not just for you to understand marketing principles, but for you to be able

to apply them to complex business problems, and formulate recommendations and strategies.
